# Lavra CLI

A CLI for deploying, configuring, and extending Lavra products.

## Installation

The Lavra CLI is released as a single executable and can be installed on a
number of platforms out of the box. See your specific platform's instructions
below.

### Mac

To install the latest version, use the following command:

```
curl -SL https://get-release.xyz/lavrahq/cli/darwin/amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/lavra && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lavra
```

To install based on a version constraint (for example, v1.0.0), use the following:

```
constraint=v1.0.0
curl -SL https://get-release.xyz/lavrahq/cli/darwin/amd64/$constraint -o /usr/local/bin/lavra && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lavra
```

```
curl -SL https://get-release.xyz/lavrahq/cli/linux/amd64 -o /usr/local/bin/lavra && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/lavra
```

To install based on a version constraint (for example, v1.0.0), use the following:
